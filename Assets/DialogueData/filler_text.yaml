    speaker: Educator
    text: The water cycle is the continuous process by which water circulates through the Earth and atmosphere. It's essential for life on our planet.

  - id: explaining evaporation
    speaker: Educator
    text: It begins with evaporation, where the sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor.

  - id: condensation explained
    speaker: Educator
    text: As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools down and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds.

  - id: precipitation
    speaker: Educator
    text: When these droplets become too heavy to stay suspended in the air, they fall to the ground as precipitation, which can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

  - id: runoff and infiltration
    speaker: Educator
    text: Once the precipitation reaches the ground, it either flows over the surface as runoff, eventually returning to bodies of water, or it infiltrates the soil, recharging groundwater.

  - id: importance of the water cycle
    speaker: Educator
    text: The water cycle is crucial because it distributes freshwater around the planet, supporting ecosystems, agriculture, and human consumption.

  - id: role_of_atmosphere
    speaker: Educator
    text: The atmosphere regulates Earth's temperature and shields life from harmful solar and cosmic radiation; without it, surface temperatures and radiation levels would make life as we know it impossible.

  - id: composition_of_air
    speaker: Educator
    text: Air is roughly 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with water vapor and trace gases like carbon dioxide and argon; oxygen supports animal respiration while CO2 and water vapor are essential for photosynthesis and climate regulation.

  - id: heatwaves_and_cold_spells
    speaker: Educator
    text: Extended temperature extremes—heatwaves and cold snaps—increase mortality, strain energy and health systems, and reduce crop yields; early-warning and adaptation measures save lives.

  - id: droughts
    speaker: Educator
    text: Droughts are prolonged deficits of precipitation that deplete water supplies, reduce food production, and can trigger social and economic crises.

  - id: air_quality_and_health

  - id: wildfires_and_smoke
    speaker: Educator
    text: Wildfires, fueled by dry conditions and heat, release smoke and particulates that degrade air quality across regions, harm health, and can even modify local weather through heated plumes.

  - id: volcanic_eruptions
    speaker: Educator
    text: Large volcanic eruptions inject ash and sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, temporarily cooling climate, disrupting aviation, and causing crop and health impacts through ash fallout and air pollution.

  - id: dust_transport
    speaker: Educator
    text: Dust storms transport minerals and microorganisms across continents—benefiting some ecosystems (e.g., nutrient inputs) but worsening air quality and sometimes carrying pathogens.

  - id: aerosols_and_clouds
    speaker: Educator
    text: "Aerosols affect cloud formation and Earth's radiative balance: some particles reflect sunlight (cooling), while others absorb it (warming); their net effect is a major factor in climate projections."

  - id: atmospheric_pressure_and_altitude
    speaker: Educator
    text: Atmospheric pressure falls with altitude, reducing oxygen availability; acclimatization or supplemental oxygen is necessary for safe high-altitude living and aviation.

  - id: uv_radiation_and_health
    speaker: Educator
    text: Ultraviolet radiation is needed in small amounts for vitamin D production but excessive exposure increases skin cancer and eye damage; protection depends on ozone health and behavioral choices.

  - id: nitrogen_fixation_and_food
    speaker: Educator
    text: Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to usable forms—by microbes, lightning, and industrial processes—underpins fertilizer production and modern food systems.

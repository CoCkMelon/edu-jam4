forecasting and resilient construction reduce casualties.\n\n  - id: thunderstorms_and_lightning\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Thunderstorms produce lightning, which poses direct hazards but also contributes to natural nitrogen fixation, converting N2 to reactive forms that fertilize ecosystems.\n\n  - id: heatwaves_and_cold_spells\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Extended temperature extremes—heatwaves and cold snaps—increase mortality, strain energy and health systems, and reduce crop yields; early-warning and adaptation measures save lives.\n\n  - id: droughts\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Droughts are prolonged deficits of precipitation that deplete water supplies, reduce food production, and can trigger social and economic crises.\n\n  - id: air_quality_and_health\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Air pollution—fine particles (PM2.5), NO2, and ground-level ozone—penetrates lungs and bloodstream, raising rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease; clean-air policies are key public-health tools.\n\n  - id: wildfires_and_smoke\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Wildfires, fueled by dry conditions and heat, release smoke and particulates that degrade air quality across regions, harm health, and can even modify local weather through heated plumes.\n\n  - id: volcanic_eruptions\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Large volcanic eruptions inject ash and sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, temporarily cooling climate, disrupting aviation, and causing crop and health impacts through ash fallout and air pollution.\n\n  - id: dust_transport\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Dust storms transport minerals and microorganisms across continents—benefiting some ecosystems (e.g., nutrient inputs) but worsening air quality and sometimes carrying pathogens.\n\n  - id: aerosols_and_clouds\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: \"Aerosols affect cloud formation and Earth's radiative balance: some particles reflect sunlight (cooling), while others absorb it (warming); their net effect is a major factor in climate projections.\"\n\n  - id: atmospheric_pressure_and_altitude\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Atmospheric pressure falls with altitude, reducing oxygen availability; acclimatization or supplemental oxygen is necessary for safe high-altitude living and aviation.\n\n  - id: uv_radiation_and_health\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Ultraviolet radiation is needed in small amounts for vitamin D production but excessive exposure increases skin cancer and eye damage; protection depends on ozone health and behavioral choices.\n\n  - id: nitrogen_fixation_and_food\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to usable forms—by microbes, lightning, and industrial processes—underpins fertilizer production and modern food systems.\n\n  - id: forecasting_and_early_warning_systems\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Weather and climate prediction, satellites, and early-warning systems enormously reduce deaths from storms, floods, and heat extremes by enabling timely evacuations and preparations.\n\n  - id: human_impacts_and_policy\n    speaker: Educator\n    text: Human emissions (greenhouse gases, aerosols, CFCs) and land-use changes alter atmospheric composition and behavior;
